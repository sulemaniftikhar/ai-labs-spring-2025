Create a system that asks the user about their car's condition and determines whether it needs 
maintenance. Use a dictionary to store predefined issue weights.  
 
Signs that a car needs maintenance may include:  
Engine noise: 4  
Check engine light: 5  
Poor fuel efficiency: 3  
Strange vibrations: 3  
Difficulty starting: 4  
Braking issues: 5  
Unusual exhaust smoke: 4  
Steering problems: 3  
Instructions:  
Ask the user if they are experiencing each issue (Yes = 1, No = 0).  
Sum the issue weights based on the userâ€™s input.  
Define a threshold of 15 to determine if maintenance is needed.  
Output Statements:  
If the total score is above the threshold (15):  
"Based on the issues reported, your car may require maintenance. It is recommended to visit a 
mechanic for a thorough inspection."  
  If the total score is below the threshold:  
"Based on the issues reported, your car does not seem to require immediate maintenance. 
However, if you are concerned, consulting a mechanic is always a good idea."
