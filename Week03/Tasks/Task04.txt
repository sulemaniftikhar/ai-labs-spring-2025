Task  4 :  
A city wants to develop a navigation system that helps users find the shortest route between two 
locations. The city is represented as a graph, where intersections (nodes) are connected by roads 
(edges) with weights representing distances.  
Graph Representation:  
•   Nodes:   Locations  
•   Edges:   Roads connecting locations, weighted by the distance between them.  
Operations:  
1.   Add locations and roads   to the city network.  
2.   Display the city map  
 
Note:  Use class concepts and graphs for writing this program.
