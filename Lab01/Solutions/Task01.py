In the AI Lab, where wonders unfold,
    A realm of code, where stories are told. 
Python, the language, so sleek and wise,
    Guides our journey through data and skies.

With if and else, we craft logic's play,
    Loops and arrays shape the digital way. 
From neural networks to data so vast,
    Python ensures our dreams hold fast.

Errors may come, but we debug and fight,
    Turning challenges into insight. 
Each line we write, a spark, a flame,
    In this AI Lab, we play the game.
    
So here's to the lab, and Python, our guide,
    With you, we conquer, horizons wide. 
A future built with logic and art,
    AI and Pythonâ€”forever a part.
